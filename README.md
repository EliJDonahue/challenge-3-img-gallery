# challenge[3] Image Gallery

## Challenge Prompt

Code for the challenge[3] on the code corgi platform

Create a web page that shows a grid of photo thumbnails; or a photo feed you can use any public API that returns photos; here are some ideas:

Imgur: https://api.imgur.com/endpoints/gallery

Flickr: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photosets.getPhotos.html

Google Image Search: https://developers.google.com/custom-search/json-api/v1/overview

## Solution

I used: 

* Vanilla JavaScript to retrieve the images from Imgur and display them in the gallery
* Bootstrap's modal component to show a selected image in a popup
* RequireJS and Firebase for deployment
